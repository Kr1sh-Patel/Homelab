# Homelab: Your DevOps Playground ðŸš€
This repository showcases a personal **Kubernetes** cluster designed to mimic real-world production environments. It serves as a platform to hone your DevOps skills by:

* **Deploying and managing applications:** Simulate application deployments, scaling, and lifecycle management using Kubernetes best practices.
* **Experimenting with configuration management:** Test and implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Ansible for repeatable configurations.
* **Building CI/CD pipelines:** Design and deploy automated pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD to streamline development workflows.
* **Mastering troubleshooting:** Practice identifying and resolving common DevOps challenges encountered in production environments like container failures, configuration errors, and resource bottlenecks.

This homelab is not just about hardware; it's about actively learning and troubleshooting in a controlled space. It demonstrates your:

* Proactive approach to professional development.
* Passion for building robust and scalable systems.
* Understanding of core DevOps principles.
Feel free to explore the codebase, see how services are deployed, and leverage this environment to solidify your DevOps skillset!

**NOTE:** This project is an ongoing learning experience. Feel free to contribute or ask questions!
